# MS-Excel
Interactive Dashboard done in MS Excel.

From the database I create Fleet Transportation Management Dashboard for a Logistics Company based in Thailand using Pivot tables.

This dashboard contains several analytics: total expenses and its breakdown salaries and wages, total expenses by month, expenses for the drivers and buddies, the total distance for the trips, total of the round trip and the one-way trip, the total monthly trips, shipments by cargo types, analysis for each trip's classified driver and buddy income per trip classify, total trips in the hired transportation. 

The client can filter the metrics shown in the dashboard by driver's name and by month.
